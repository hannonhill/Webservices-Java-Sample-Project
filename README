Version History:
	- 0.1 Initial Version
	- 0.2 Updating instructions to use custom property to specify lib locations instead of adding libs manually

Prerequisites: 

This assumes you have Eclipse 3.4+ and Ant 1.7+ installed and configured
for your development environment, as well as the included Axis libraries.

Eclipse can be downloaded at: http://download.eclipse.org
Ant can be downloaded at: http://ant.apache.org/

It is recommended you set up your environment in the following manner:

1.) Create a "java" directory. Unzip Ant, Eclipse into it.
2.) Add the ant executable to your path. You should be able to type "ant" on the command line
	and see ant (attempt to) run, something like:
	C:\>ant
	Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
	Build failed
	
3.) Create a "workspace" folder in your java folder. This will be the root of your Eclipse workspace.
	When you start Eclipse for the first time, tell it to use this folder as the workspace folder. If
	you are already using Eclipse and have already designated a workspace folder, you can continue using
	that foloder.
	
Next we will bring the project into Eclipse. To do this:

1.) Unzip/move the contents of this zip file to your Eclipse workspace directory.
2.) Import the project into Eclipse by choosing File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace 
	and choosing the "Cascade Webservices" folder (this is the root of the project).

After this you should see the Cascade Webservices project show up in your Eclipse window. Do not be alarmed if 
there are compilation errors, this is because you still need to generate the Java client stubs for interacting 
with the web services layer.

To do this:

1.) Open the WSDL from your Cascade Server instance by going to: http://<your-cascade-url>/ws/services/AssetOperationService?wsdl
2.) Save this as a file "asset-operation.wsdl".
3.) Replace the "asset-operation.wsdl" file in src/java/wsdl inside the eclipse project with your own file.
4.) Open a command-line/terminal window to run ant. 
5.) Navigate to to the base directory where the project was unzipped to 
    (for example, java/workspace/Cascade Webservices) and type the command "ant"

	You should see a successful ant build similar to:

	C:\Java\workspace\Cascade Webservices>ant
	Buildfile: build.xml

	clean:

	generate-stubs:
	[wsdl2java] WSDL2Java C:\Java\workspace\Cascade Webservices\src\java\wsdl\asset-
	operation.wsdl

	BUILD SUCCESSFUL
	Total time: 1 second

6.) Refresh the project by right clicking on the project and selecting "Refresh".

At this point Eclipse will re-build the project for you. You should not see any red x's
on any files (which indicate java compilation errors). You should then be able to run the
"TestRead" application to ensure the local axis webservices infrastructure can communicate with your
Cascade Server instance. Remember, that your Cascade instance must be running for the Web Service
to execute.
